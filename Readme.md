Give your visitors control on which song or playlist they want to listen to. User will not be able to override currently playing song.

This plugin was created from an idea that a member of ELF (European Lighting Fanatics) facebook group had. It was very manual and was a lot of setup steps. Integrating everything into fpp allow the ease of setup. With the built in kiosk mode in fpp you are able to display the Jukebox page on boot up to a screen of your choice ideally touchscreen.
